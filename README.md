# sebsite - my personal website

hi git friend! see below for some  info on this site!

## narrative
i made this website over the course of a few days in dec 2024. while the design, layout and components on this site are 'from scratch', i used a couple of tools which i'd highly recommend. v0 is excellent for iterating FE designs and ([obv](https://x.com/0xgaut/status/1829569167810318603)) cursor when developing... i found the new 'bug finder' feature to be useful in this project. i attempted to use the figma <--> v0 connector after creating some mocks, but really didn't like the outcome.
